              <p>
                After graduating from the University of Toronto, I landed my first job at a kitchen automation startup in Oakville named Gastronomous. 
                As the Lead Product Design Engineer at Gastronomous, I was tasked with developing the first working commercial autonomous grill. 
                This product brings some of the principles of automation to this industry by using an indexing mechanism which rotates the grill and
                brings the patty to different working zones. One zone flips the patty, another records the internal temperature, another ejects the 
                finished patty and the last cleans the grill spot the patty was on. This product aims to increase efficiency, quality and combat
                labour shortage of grill workers for various chains.

                <br><br>Before I had arrived, all Gastronomous had were renders and unfinished 3D models. My tasks started with creating a product data
                management system to ensure that the designs would be well organized and ready to share externally. Upon creating a robust system for part
                tracking, I went on to completeing the planned design and assembly of submechanisms, including providing technical engineering drawings for
                manufacturing and assembling the product. As the only engineer at the time, I wore many hats and worked with clients, suppliers and stakeholders
                to determine the functions, objectives and constraints of each component. I had an intimate understanding of each component and its requirements.
                Upon building and testing the first prototype, we began the design of V2, incorporating all our learnings from the prototype.

                The HPVDT team is competing for the Kremer International Marathon Prize, and I was tasked with developing a CNC machine to manufacture the wings
                from a 3D CAD model. I had never previously built a CNC machine, however I had a good understanding of how the machined worked and operated. I
                compartmentalized the tasks of the project and researched and delivered my findings one by one. I was able to learn quite a bit about stepper motors,
                drivers, limit switches and arduino programming in order to deliver a workign CNC machine with instructions on how to use the software to create wings
                for the vehicle.<br><br> 
                
                This CNC machine takes two 2D cross sections from a 3D CAD model and translates it into G-code to cut out a long prism with the two cross sections at each end.
                This machine was able to provide very accurate cuts that followed our 3D CAD perfectly. This was done using 4 axes controlled by a motor and leadscrew, two axes moved one end of a hot wire
                vertiaclly and horizontally while the other two moved the other end of the hot wire.

                As a member of the Autopilot and Electronics Product Design team, one of the electronics I was the lead on was the bluetooth sensors that allowed
                for keyless entry. This project focused on the Model X revamp knonw as Plaid. Since most of the form factor stayed the same for the Plaid model, I
                was tasked with retrofitting bluetooth (BLE), nearfield communication (NFC), and ultrawide band (UWB) sensors into the existing B-pillar camera enclosure. This required
                working closely with the embedded systems engineer to determine the PCB design to ensure all requirements are met.<br><br>

                With a complex, highley aesthetic and user experience oriented project like this, lots of focus must be put into testing and ensuring we get the 
                desired functionality reliably. For example, the range of each antenna was incredibly important, if the sensor was too far from the glass or too close
                to metals in the body of the vehicle, the range could be compromised. To overcome these obstacles, I had to use techniques and components I had no
                experience with prior to this project such as flex PCBs, pogo pin connectors, heat staking and tolerance stack analysis.<br><br>

                Another part of this project was conducting a study to see how moisture and fog impacted the camera system. I needed to recreate real world conditions
                of the apparatus so I learned how to program a thermal chamber and create a testing rig that would orient the product correctly tot est how temperature
                and humidity would effect performance. I learned about psychrometric charts and how they impact visability in vehicles, and made suggestions to remedy the
                issue across the fleet of vehicles, sharing my findings with my team for future products.

              <p>
                As a Canadian working in California at the time, I was interested with how self driving capabilites would function in a cold snowy climate. Cameras, radars
                and ultrasonic sensors all play a part in the self-driving aspect of the car. The radar heater was a solution developed for when the radar is blocked by
                snow, ice or water droplets. I worked with suppliers of both the radar and the heater to ensure that the mechanical design of the heater did not block the 
                radar signal. Furthermore, the connector selection requirement was that it is IP69K rated, ensuring no chance for water or debris to cause a short cirquit.
                This required the use of advanced surfacing techniques on CATIA to map out the radar field of view. After the dimensions were verified, the engineering
                drawing was drafted and shared with the suppliers. <br><br>
                
                I led many tests to ensure that the heater met our requirements. This included radar visibility, which I developed with the Radar team at Tesla to ensure
                that the heater pattern did not block the radar vision. Another test was ensuring that the heater pattern resulted in uniform heat distribution and was 
                capable of clearing snow within 5 minutes, this was done using a FLIR temperature camera and thermocouples with a data logger. Furthermore, the heater 
                needed to resist any vibration from the vehicle, here I worked with the Vibrations team at Tesla and supplied them with a test fixture to mount the 
                fascia of the vehicle. <br><br>

                One design problem was specific to the Model 3 as it's fascia had a different geometry which owuld make adding an adheive difficult. For this, I suggested
                having slits on the heater so that the planar shape could conform to the odd shape of the fascia. This seemed to adhere much better leaving minimal bubbles.<br><Br>
                
                The algorithm for this solution needed to work preemptively, ensuring that the radar never had the opportunity to be blocked. By leading cross-cisciplinary
                meetings, I was able to help design an algorithm that works based on information from the camera, temperature readings and location to determine a
                digital on-off procedure for the heater. This algorithm was patented by Tesla.

                During my time as a student in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Toronto, I attended many extra-curricular weekend courses. Amongst them
                was a basic machining course at George Brown University. In this course, we machined an assembly of an air piston from engineering drawings. We were
                trained to use a manual operated mill, lathe, grinder, drill press and band saw. Furthermore we were taugh basic machine safety tips, understanding

                Paired with the responsability of owning the Model X Plaid B Pillar was owning the Model X Plaid Keyfob. No additional antennas were
                required to be added, however there was an issue with some shipped Model X keys where customers would report premature battery death.
                The cause of this was the fact that the Model X Keyfob was paired to the car as soon as it comes off the assembly line, so the keyfob is
                shipped with the car. Cars that are last in queue to be delivered to customers can sit in a lot for nearly a year, depleting the battery over
                time. Since changing the current pairing and assembly process would require millions of dollars of capital, my suggestion was to have a battery
                pull tab that was able to be actuated in both directions, allowing the factory worker to engage and disengage the battery repeatedly. The process
                would be as follows: 
                <br><br>1. Keyfob arrives to car with battery disengaged 2.Keyfob pairing worker would pull one end to engage the battery and pair the 
                keyfob to the car 3.Keyfob worker would then pull the tab the opposite direction to disengage the battery and thus save battery until the keyfob arrives
                to the sales representative. 4. The sales representative would tear off the tab at the perforated line for a clean rip and pull out the tab fully before
                giving it to the customer.<br><br>

                This project required some creativity and lots of testing to ensure proper functionality of the tab as well as developing a robust and simple way to teach process
                workers how to use the tab and the purpose of it without interrupting their process time.

                The Rocketry division of UTAT was focused on breaking the Canadian Junior Altitude Record with our in-house designed rocket. I was part of the exteriors
                team, mainly working on the design and manufacturing of the exterior body of the rocket, including the mandrel, fins, and nosecone. Here I learned 
                a lot about working with composites and applied learnings of material properties to ensure that the exterior body could handle the loads on the rocket.

                During COVID, I was interested in doing something as a hobby from home. As I had already done a little wood working with some basic tools, I decided
                to push things to the next level and invest in a hobby grade vertical CNC mill which I could assemble myself. This CNC uses two motors connected by a 
                chain which holds a mounted router whose depth is controlled by a third motor. The machine is able to take G-Code and follow programmed paths to cut out
                any desired path from a 4' x 8' wood canvas with upto 2" in thickness. I plan to use this for innovative furniture designs and for hobby grade souvenirs.

                As a side venture, a friend and I looked into providing a warehouse floor plan layout with a local business with some extra space. I took measurements
                and created a to-scale 3D model of the area to optimize the amount of racks we could fit in without compromise forklit maneuverability. We also provided
                an outline of a business proposal, conveying information such as responsibilities, tasks, team member roles and the division of equity.

                As one of my first projects at Tesla, I was tasked with setting up an intrusion test study which made use of a mechanical testing rig that would fire
                an arm into the front seat windows to see if they trigger the driver facing cameras. This testing was legally required to be done to show that the
                driver facing camera could be used effectively as an intrusion sensor.

              <p>
                In a course at UofT, I was the team leader of 5 peers to design in CAD and write a detailed report of the working mechanisms of a functioning 3D
                Printer. The product was designed for low-cost hobbyist application as a quick desktop printer. This meant keeping the frame as small as possible and using
                as few components as possible while stille creating a reliable print with good accuracy. The results were evaluated based on objectives established during the first design stages.<br><br>
                I led the brainstorming with my team to determine the overarching mechanical principals to be used for the design, we settled on leadscrews for the 
                linear motion along axes as they were compact and required few parts. Standard parts available for cheaper prices were favoured to meet out low cost objective.
                The team used SolidWorks to design and simulate the 3D Printer model and motion which was also shared with a detailed engineering report, technical drawings and an oral presentation.
